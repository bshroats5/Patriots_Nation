## How It Went Down

Juan Bullard Jr. put the Patriots up 6-0 after breaking a tackle on a pass from Gregg and taking it **66 yards for a touchdown**. Major Newman then hauled in the two-point conversion to make it 8-0. Union responded quickly to tie it at 8-8, but UC soon took control. Gregg connected with Cade Lamb on a **46-yard strike** to give the Patriots a 15-8 lead after the first quarter.

Early in the second quarter, Lamb hauled in another touchdown pass from Gregg—this time from **51 yards out**—stretching the lead to 21-8. With 7:30 left before halftime, Gregg called his own number for a rushing score to make it 28-8. The score held until the break after Job Matossian’s **47-yard field goal attempt** missed at the buzzer.

The Patriots continued to dominate in the third quarter, shutting out the Bulldogs and pushing the lead to 35-8 thanks to Gregg’s fourth touchdown pass, this one to Michael Petty. Union finally ended their scoring drought with a late field goal after recovering a Gregg fumble, making it 35-11 heading into the fourth.

UC opened the final quarter with a **2-yard rushing touchdown from Jayden Clayton**, extending the margin to 42-11. From there, the Patriots turned to their second-string players to close out the win.
