# Rankings Rant Again  

The Soccer and Volleyball rankings were released today and my goodness does the NAIA hate us. For the third ranking in a row the Patriots Volleyball team is #10 in the country. They refuse to move us up despite us just continuing to dominate our opponents. Teams ahead of us have even lost multiple matches yet we are stuck in cement. 

The Men's soccer team is 6th. However, there are two other Mid-South Conference ahead of the Patriots (Bethel 4th and Lindsey Wilson 5th). How cana team win the conference but have two of their opponents are ranked ahead of them. Make it make sense NAIA.
