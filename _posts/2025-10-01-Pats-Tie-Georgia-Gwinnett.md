It was a match that both teams could argue they should have left with a win, but it ended in a hard-fought 1-1 draw between two very good teams.

### **Game Recap: PATRIOTS 1, GGC 1**

Alright, so it wasn't a W, but you know what this was? A **BATTLE**. A down-and-dirty, knock-down, drag-out fight on the road, and we didn't blink.

They got us in the first half, you have to give them that. They caught us sleeping for a second around the 28-minute mark and put one in the net. You could tell it was going to be a chippy oneâ€”cards were flying and fouls were everywhere. But you think that's going to slow us down? Please.

We came out of the half with a purpose. We started pressuring, controlling the ball, and just daring them to keep up. You could feel it coming. Then, around the 64-minute mark, the breakthrough! **Samuel Dolobaipu** found the back of the net to tie this thing up! **THE EQUALIZER!** That's the grit and heart you want to see!

From there on out, it was all us. We outshot them 9-5 for the game, had more corners, and kept their keeper busy. They were just holding on for dear life at the end. We walk out of there with a point, and we'll take it. We showed some real toughness coming back from a goal down.

Tough game, tough result, but we don't quit. *On to the next one.* **LET'S GOOOO.**
