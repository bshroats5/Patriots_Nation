### 9-1. Dominance. We Protected Our Home Court.

Another game, another decisive victory. We defended Randy Vernon Court, defeating Indiana University Southeast 87-56. That's a 31-point win. We're now 9-1 on the season. This is the standard. This is how we execute.

---

### First Quarter: We Set the Tone Early

We came out with the intensity we demand. From the opening tip, we imposed our will, quickly establishing a **10-0 lead** within the first four minutes. Jaydyn Carrico got us on the board, Lakin Burke followed with a put-back, and Darcie Anderson sparked us with a three-pointer, a steal, and an assist. We forced turnovers, capitalized on offensive rebounds, and Fredricks asserted herself inside. We finished the quarter with a commanding **28-15 lead**, shooting an outstanding 50% from the field and **80% from three**. That's how you start a game.

### Second Quarter: A Lapse, Then a Response

We had a lapse. Indiana Southeast showed some fight, going on a **13-3 run** midway through the quarter to cut our lead to just three points. That's a lack of focus. That's not acceptable. But this team knows how to respond. We immediately answered with a **5-0 run** to close the half, including a clutch three from Darcie Anderson, pushing our lead back to double-digits at **45-35**. We weathered their best shot and maintained control. That's championship character, but the lapse itself needs to be addressed.

### Third Quarter: We Shut Them Down. Period.

This is where we broke their will. We came out of halftime and completely dominated, holding Indiana Southeast to a pathetic **7 points** in the entire quarter. That's elite defense. We extended our lead from 16 to **25 points (67-42)** by the end of the third. Carrico was active, Anderson delivered a critical block, and we simply out-physicaled them on every possession. This is the kind of suffocating defense we expect for 40 minutes.

### Fourth Quarter: Finishing the Job

With the game firmly in hand, we continued to execute. Joy Kendrick knocked down a three, and Zaram Fredricks continued her work inside, setting up Anderson for a layup. We maintained a lead as large as **33 points**, with MacKenzie Babb and Alexia Wilson closing out the game with efficient scoring. We finished the game shooting 64.29% from the field in the final frame, not allowing any late comebacks. We finished strong.

### The Execution Report: How We Dominated

This was a victory built on controlling the paint, suffocating defense, and balanced offensive aggression.

*   **Absolute Domination on the Glass:** We outrebounded Indiana Southeast by a staggering **56-22**. This is a two-to-one advantage. We grabbed **19 offensive rebounds** (to their 7), leading directly to **20 second-chance points** (to their 3). When you control the boards, you control the game. Period.
*   **Owned the Paint:** We dictated the game inside, outscoring them **40-14 in points in the paint**. Our forwards asserted their physical will.
*   **Lights-Out Shooting:** We shot **49.2% from the field** and an outstanding **52.6% from three-point range (10-for-19)**. We forced them to respect every player on the floor.
*   **Bench Depth:** Our reserves were instrumental, outscoring their bench **29-2**. That's the depth that wins championships.

### Individual Performance Review: Doing Their Job

*   **Zaram Fredricks (#14):** A dominant force. Her **fourth double-double of the season** with **11 points and a game-high 17 rebounds** (8 offensive). She controlled the paint, intimidated shooters, and was relentless on the glass. That's the standard.
*   **Lakin Burke (#20):** Another double-double, recording **12 points and a season-high 13 rebounds** (5 offensive) in just 22 minutes. Her effort and efficiency off the bench were critical.
*   **Joy Kendrick (#05):** The floor general. She orchestrated the offense with **6 assists**, scored **14 points**, and pulled down 8 rebounds. She dictated the tempo and made plays.
*   **Aden Clark (#08):** A huge offensive spark. She poured in **14 points**, hitting **4 of her 6 three-point attempts**, and added **6 assists**. She stretched their defense and found open teammates.
*   **Darcie Anderson (#02):** An all-around impactful performance with **11 points, 5 rebounds, 2 blocks, and 2 steals**. She was everywhere, making plays on both ends.
*   **Jaydyn Carrico (#03):** Contributed **10 points** and 3 assists, providing consistent scoring.

### Areas for Correction

Even in a 31-point win, we're not satisfied.

*   **Turnovers:** We had **18 turnovers**. That's too many. We need to value the basketball more consistently. Every possession matters.
*   **Free Throw Shooting:** 13-for-20 (65%) is still not where we need to be. We left points on the board. This comes down to focus and repetition.
*   **Defensive Lapses:** The brief run they had in the second quarter. Elite teams play 40 minutes of suffocating defense.

### Next Up

The Patriots are done for a holiday break. The next game is December 2 vs Washington Adventist University.
