It was a perfect night for soccer at the UC Soccer Complex as the Cumberlands Patriots defended their home turf with a dominant doubleheader sweep over rival Campbellsville. Both the men's and women's teams pitched shutouts, combining for five goals while completely suffocating the Tigers' offenses all evening.

### Women's Team Erupts in 4-0 Offensive Showcase

The Patriots women's team put on an offensive clinic from the opening whistle, dismantling the Tigers in a 4-0 rout. The story of the night was the unstoppable duo of **Nicole Araujo** and **Abigail Little**, who had a hand in every single goal in a breathtaking performance.

The scoring started early, as **Abigail Little** found the back of the net in just the 10th minute off assists from **Alba Ramirez** and **Araujo**. Just over ten minutes later, **Nicole Araujo** scored a goal of her own to give the Patriots a commanding 2-0 lead heading into halftime.

The second half was more of the same dominant display. The duo struck again just three minutes into the period, with **Little** setting up **Araujo** for her second goal of the night. They capped off their incredible performance in the 57th minute when **Araujo** assisted **Little** for her second goal, sealing the 4-0 victory. The Patriots dominated every phase of the game, outshooting the Tigers 20-5. The defense was a brick wall, allowing just two shots on goal, both of which were handled easily by keeper **Morgan White** to preserve the clean sheet.

### Men's Team Secures 1-0 Defensive Masterclass

In the nightcap, the men's team put on a defensive masterclass, completely shutting down the Tigers on their way to a convincing 1-0 victory.

The Patriots controlled the match from the start, and their pressure paid off in the 26th minute. Off a beautiful build-up, **Mario Fernandez** and **Carles Diez Herrero** connected to find **Leandro Nico Romero Protto**, who buried the ball in the back of the net for the go-ahead goal. That single score would be all the Patriots needed, as the defense put on an absolutely suffocating performance. They held Campbellsville to just a single shot for the entire 90-minute match. Goalkeeper **Javiero Izquierdo** handled the lone attempt with ease to secure the shutout and the victory.
