Oregon Tech brought their perfect record across the United States and they are leaving with a L. Zaram Fredricks absolutely dominated in the paint and Peyton Mounce dominated on offense(as did many other Patriots) to get back in the win column and knock off OTU 85-67.

### #19 HANDS #15 THEIR FIRST LOSS. WE IMPOSED OUR WILL.

Their perfect season? Over. Our record? 7-1. This wasn't just another win; this was a statement. We executed the game plan, controlled the tempo, and proved that when we play our brand of basketball, we're a force to be reckoned with.

---

### First Quarter: We Set The Tone

We came out with the intensity demanded for a ranked matchup. From the opening tip, we seized control. A quick three from Peyton Mounce, followed by an Aden Clark triple, and we had the lead. We held Oregon Tech to just **12 points** in the first ten minutes while putting up **25 of our own**, hitting 57.1% from three. We established early that this was going to be *our* game.

### Second & Third Quarters: Sustained Dominance

They tried to respond. They made runs. But we had an answer every single time. In the second quarter, we continued our offensive efficiency, shooting 50% from the field and 60% from deep, pushing our lead to a comfortable margin. The third quarter saw both teams score 19, but we maintained our significant advantage. We led for **39 minutes and 23 seconds** of this game. That's a comprehensive performance.

### Fourth Quarter: We Closed It Out

We took our foot off the gas in the fourth quarter, scoring only 15 points and shooting a dismal 15.4% from the field. That's not the standard. However, when they tried to make a final push, we found ways to score, especially from the free-throw line, hitting **11-for-11 (100%)** in the final frame to seal the victory. We bent, but we didn't break. The job was finished.

### The Execution Report: How We Broke Their Undefeated Record

This was a victory built on relentless effort, especially in the dirty work aspects of the game.

*   **We Dominated the Glass:** This is non-negotiable. We outrebounded them **49-28**, including an incredible **21 offensive rebounds to their 11**. This led directly to **23 second-chance points** (to their 10). When you get twice as many offensive rebounds as your opponent, you control the game.
*   **A Defensive Wall:** We protected the paint. We blocked **8 shots** compared to their 2. Zaram Fredricks was an absolute force, turning away 6 attempts on her own. We made them earn every single basket inside.
*   **Precision from Deep:** We shot **41.2% from three-point range (7-for-17)**, effectively stretching their defense and creating space. This was a stark contrast to their 16.7% (2-for-12). We owned the perimeter.
*   **Bench Production:** Our reserves came ready to play, outscoring Oregon Tech's bench **24-11**. That's the depth and commitment we demand from every player on the roster.

### Individual Performance Review: Players Who Executed

*   **Zaram Fredricks (#14):** An absolute force on the glass and a defensive anchor. She pulled down a staggering **17 rebounds** (14 defensive, 3 offensive) and recorded a career-high **6 blocks**. She dictated the interior battle. This is the effort we expect.
*   **Peyton Mounce (#01):** A spark plug off the bench, leading the team in scoring with **15 points** on efficient 6-of-12 shooting, including **3-of-6 from beyond the arc**. She was relentless on the offensive boards, grabbing **6 offensive rebounds**.
*   **Joy Kendrick (#05):** A consistent offensive threat, contributing **14 points** and hitting **8-of-9 from the free-throw line** when it mattered most. She found ways to score and run the offense.
*   **Lakin Burke (#20):** Another impactful performance off the bench, adding **13 points** (3-of-6 FG, 1-of-1 3P) and making crucial free throws (6-of-9).
*   **Darcie Anderson (#02):** The floor general, orchestrating the offense, providing **2 assists**, and setting the tone on defense with **3 steals**. She finished with **11 points**.

### Areas for Immediate Correction

We'll take the win, especially against a ranked opponent. But we're not satisfied.

*   **Turnovers:** We had **17 turnovers**. That's too many. We need to value every possession, especially against high-quality competition.
*   **Fourth Quarter Execution:** While we closed out, our offensive efficiency dropped significantly (2-of-13 from the field). We cannot take our foot off the gas when a team is fighting to get back in. We need to finish stronger.
*   **Free Throw Shooting (Overall):** 70.3% is acceptable, but with 37 attempts, we left 11 points on the board. We need to be closer to 80% every night.

### What's Next

The #19 Patriots will travel to face St.Marys of the Woods on Saturday 11/22.
