With the Women's Soccer Team wrapping up their season after finishing as the NAIA runners up we ought to recap how the Fall sports teams did this season. We will be recapping the Football, Volleyball, and both Soccer programs and their 2025 seasons. 

### Football Season

This is the hardest team to judge out of any of the fall teams on campus. If you look at the record at 4-6 it would be easy to say this season was a disappointment. On the other hand you have to note that the Mid-South Conference is a top league in the NAIA football world. They went 1-1 in rivalries keeping the Brass Lantern in Williamsburg but losing the Cumberlands Bowl in OT. I was hoping they would go at least 5-5 or maybe even 6-4. You could argue they were just a play or 2 from 5-5 or 6-4 with single possession losses at Faulkner (35-36 OT), at Cumberland ( 37-40 OT), and vs Georgetown College (28-35). If they had won those games they go 7-3 and finish tied for 2nd in the MSC.

### Volleyball Season

This is the most heartbreaking recap I will write out. This was a team of destiny and because they were never given the proper respect from the NAIA they were sent home earlier than they should had been. The team went 36-1 shattering school records on their way. However, they were never ranked higher than 9th and were given the 9 seed. They would host their first ever NAIA second round game and made it to Sioux City. They would sweep Midland for their first ever tournament match in Sioux City. They would then face the 8 seed McPherson, who was also seeded criminally low. They would go 5 sets and fall to McPherson for their ONLY loss on the season. 

### Men's Soccer 

The Men's Soccer program finished last year after losing in a shootout in the NAIA Semifinals. I was not sure what to expect from these guys as they lost some key players but also returned some other key players. They started the season off with highs and lows. However, once Mid-South play arrived they were up for the challenge and won the regular season title. They would fall in the MSC Semi-Finals and ear an at large spot in the NAIA tourney. They would go on another run to the Semis before falling to Grand View who won the NAIA National Title today. 

### Women's Soccer

I can almost copy and paste the Men's recap and it would be true here. I did have higher expectations for them than the Men's team and they met those expectations. I strongly feel they were the better team today and should had been the National Champions. However, this is soccer and Keiser was determined to not go out with a fight. They equalized in the second and both teams were content with PKs. Keiser would prevail in PKs 3-2. The future is bright for this squad and will be led in the future by Freshman goalkeeper **Morgan White**
