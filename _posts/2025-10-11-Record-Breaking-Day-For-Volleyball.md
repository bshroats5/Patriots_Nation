The #10 Cumberlands Patriots volleyball team etched their names in the program record books Saturday afternoon, dismantling Freed-Hardeman 3-0 (25-15, 25-9, 25-17) to claim their 20th consecutive victory. The win officially sets a new program record for the longest winning streak and marks their 15th straight sweep, and 48 straight sets, continuing an absolutely unprecedented run of dominance.

The Patriots put on a masterclass on both sides of the ball, hitting a blistering .452 on offense while putting up a defensive brick wall that held the Lions to a staggering -.056 hitting percentage for the match.

### Set 1: Setting the Tone

The Patriots established control early and never looked back. With the score tied 4-4, a serving run by **Brynnley Bryant** sparked a 5-0 burst that included two kills from **Sara Zampedri** to give UC a lead they would not relinquish. The balanced attack was too much for the Lions, as kills from **Kara Gipson** and **Elaina Fischer** helped the Patriots cruise to a 25-15 victory.

### Set 2: A Defensive Masterpiece

The second frame was one of the most dominant sets of the season for Cumberlands. The Patriots' front line was simply impenetrable. After an early kill by Freed-Hardeman, a 7-0 run behind the serving of **Davey Slaughter** gave the Patriots a commanding 8-1 lead. Later, with the score 13-7, **Sara Zampedri** took over from the service line, leading an incredible 11-0 run that included multiple blocks from **Kara Gipson** and **Elaina Fischer**. The defensive clinic resulted in a lopsided 25-9 win.

### Set 3: Closing Out History

With history on the line, the Patriots sealed the record-breaking victory with authority. The Lions kept it close early, but Cumberlands pulled away midway through the set. Leading 10-9, kills from **Kara Gipson** and **Sara Zampedri** started to build the lead. The Patriots closed the match in style, scoring the final four points, capped by a service ace from **Davey Slaughter** to start the celebration.
