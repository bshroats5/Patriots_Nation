Both the Men's and Women's Soccer Teams competed as underdogs in the NAIA Sweet 16 tonight, while the Men's Basketball Team took its undefeated record on the road to IU Southeast. Despite giving Patriots Nation a collective scare, all three teams prevailed.

## Ladies First. The Patriots Knock Off 4 Seed College of Idaho. 
We faced their best shot early. College of Idaho took the lead with a header off a corner kick at the 19:12 mark. But this team doesn't panic. This team responds. Just three minutes later, **Karla Waibel** delivered the equalizer, powering in a shot from 8 yards out off a **Samantha Sokolove** corner. That's execution. We weren't done. With just minutes left in the half, **Nicole Araujo** elevated for a crucial header off a cross from **Juana Fernandez Calvo**, slipping it past their keeper to give us a 2-1 lead heading into the break. We answered, we adjusted, and we took control.

### Second Half: A Defensive Stand

The second half was a grind. College of Idaho came out aggressive, pushing to tie the game. They found a deflected shot in the 75th minute that leveled the score. That's a mental lapse we'll address in film. But from that moment on, our defense locked in. **Morgan White** stood tall in goal, making crucial saves to keep us in it. We went toe-to-toe, refusing to give an inch, and forcing overtime.

### Double Overtime: The Game-Winner!

There's no quit in this team. In the second period of extra time, with penalties looming, we made the play that mattered. **Samantha Sokolove** once again delivered a perfect ball into the box, and **Carola Fontan** stepped up, hitting a clinical volley from 8 yards out to secure the 3-2 victory! That's clutch. That's championship mentality. We finished the job.

### Our Dominators on the Pitch

*   **Zaram Fredricks (#14):** A brick wall inside. While not on the score sheet, her presence alone dictated offensive flow and her physical play allowed our offense to thrive.
*   **Samantha Sokolove (#21):** The architect of victory. Two assists, both on game-changing goals off corner kicks. Her delivery under pressure was elite.
*   **Morgan White (#01):** Our last line of defense. She stood tall in net, making **10 crucial saves** against a dangerous attack. When the game was on the line, she made the plays.
*   **Carola Fontan (#11):** The hero. The game-winning goal in double overtime. When the lights were brightest, she delivered.
*   **Nicole Araujo (#10):** A consistent offensive threat, scoring our go-ahead goal in the first half and forcing their keeper to make 5 saves.

### By The Numbers

*   **Shot Efficiency:** We took **21 shots, with 13 on target**, ensuring constant pressure on their goalkeeper.
*   **Corner Kick Advantage:** We dominated corner kicks **7-3**, turning two of them directly into goals. That's execution from set pieces.
*   **Mental Toughness:** We outlasted them in a physical, high-stakes game. We bent, but we never broke.

### What's Next

This was a statement win. We beat a quality opponent and showed we belong. But the job's not finished. We'll celebrate this one, then we'll watch the film, clean up the defensive lapses, and prepare for the Elite Eight. We're on to the next one. We will face the winner of Life vs John Brown on Thursday.

### MEN'S SOCCER: GRIT. RESILIENCE. SWEET SIXTEEN SHOOTOUT VICTORY!

This is how you win in the NAIA Tournament. This is what it means to play for this program. We battled #16 Life University for 110 minutes of intense football, finishing 2-2 in double overtime, and then we delivered a flawless performance in the penalty shootout to advance to the Elite Eight! This was a test of heart, and we showed we have it.

### First Half: A Back-And-Forth Battle

The first half was a whirlwind. We struck first, with **Tjerk Meijs** scoring the opening goal off an assist from **Mario Fernandez** at the 20:35 mark. That's how you establish dominance. But Life responded quickly, scoring two goals in rapid succession to take a 2-1 lead. This is where lesser teams fold. Not us. We showed our resolve, forcing an own goal just three minutes later to tie the game at 2-2. That's resilience. We created the pressure, and they buckled.

### Second Half & Overtime: A Defensive Masterclass

After the first-half fireworks, both teams locked down. The second half and two periods of overtime were a testament to our defensive strategy and unwavering commitment. We choked off their attack, limiting their clear chances and making crucial clearances. Our backline and midfield refused to let them break through. This was a mental and physical battle, and we stood firm for 80 minutes of scoreless, suffocating football.

### The Penalty Shootout: Flawless Execution

This is where champions are made. After 110 minutes, it came down to ice in the veins. Our guys stepped up to the spot and delivered under immense pressure. **Gabriel Canineu**, **Ryota Nakamura**, **Adrian Choco**, **Emil Skursch**, and **Leandro Nico Romero** – five penalties, five perfect finishes. On the other end, **Javiero Izquierdo** stood tall in goal, denying their attempts and securing the victory. That's pressure. That's execution. That's advancing.

### Our Warriors on the Pitch

*   **Tjerk Meijs (#25):** Scored our opening goal, setting the tone for our offensive attack.
*   **Mario Fernandez (#10):** Provided the assist for the first goal, demonstrating his playmaking ability.
*   **The Entire Backline & Midfield:** Held a dangerous Life offense scoreless for 80 consecutive minutes of regulation and overtime. That's disciplined, tenacious defense.
*   **Javiero Izquierdo (#99):** Our rock in goal. He made crucial saves throughout the game and was a dominant presence in the shootout, directly contributing to our advancement.
*   **The Penalty Takers (Canineu, Nakamura, Choco, Skursch, Romero):** Unflappable under the highest pressure. Their perfect execution is why we're moving on.

### By The Numbers

*   **Defensive Grit:** We held Life to just **1 shot on goal in the second half and overtime periods combined**. We shut them down when it mattered most.
*   **Efficiency:** Despite fewer shots (9-3 total), we generated enough quality chances and capitalized on their mistakes.
*   **Penalty Perfection:** We hit 5 out of 5 penalties in the shootout. That's the ultimate display of composure.

### What's Next

This was a defining victory. We fought, we clawed, and we advanced. The Elite Eight is next. We'll get the bodies right, watch the film, and prepare for the next challenge. The job's not finished. We're on to the next one. We will face the winner of Warner Pacific vs LSU Shreveport.

### MEN'S BASKETBALL: 10-0! THE PERFECT START CONTINUES!

We are 10-0. We defended our home court against Indiana Southeast, securing a 76-68 victory. We went out, we executed the game plan, and we kept our undefeated season alive. This is the standard. This is what we expect.

### First Half: We Dominated. Period.

We came out with a clear message: this is our house. We exploded in the first quarter, establishing a commanding **24-point lead (39-15)** at the 9:22 mark. Kyle Duke was back, and he was a problem. Andrew McConnell hit a three off a Malachi Robinson steal, Duke was hitting from everywhere, and our defensive intensity was stifling. We shot **51.4% from the field**, **50% from three (8-for-16)**, and a perfect **100% from the free-throw line (8-for-8)**. We held them to just 31 points. That's how you play Patriots basketball.

### Second Half: A Lesson in Sustained Effort

The second half wasn't our best performance. We gave up 37 points and only scored 24. That's a lapse in intensity that will be addressed. We allowed them to cut into our lead, especially in the middle of the quarter. That's unacceptable. However, when the game started to get tight, we responded. We locked back in defensively, and most importantly, we were flawless from the free-throw line down the stretch. We finished strong, preventing any dramatic comeback. We learned a lesson, and we still got the win.

### The Execution Report: The Relentless Push to 10-0

This was a victory earned through consistent pressure and a refusal to lose.

*   **Kyle Duke's Return:** Our leader was back, and he delivered. **22 points** on 6-for-17 shooting, including **4-for-8 from three**, and a perfect **6-for-6 from the free-throw line**. He facilitated the offense and made clutch shots when we needed them. His presence changes everything.
*   **Malachi Robinson's Defensive Masterclass:** He was a force. **3 blocks, 3 steals**, and 5 rebounds. He stifled their attack and created offensive opportunities for us. When he's engaged on defense, we're a different team.
*   **Tanner Walton's Impact:** While his scoring was low (4 points), his all-around game was huge: **5 assists, 3 steals, and a block**. He was distributing the ball and disrupting their offense. That's what we need from him.
*   **Bench Contributions:** Our bench once again provided a spark, outscoring their reserves **23-21**. Anthony Harris delivered 7 points on efficient shooting, and Brant Smithers chipped in 10.
*   **Clutch Free Throw Shooting:** When it mattered most, we delivered. We went **14-for-16 (87.5%) from the free-throw line**, ensuring they couldn't cut the lead down the stretch. That's focus.

### Our Dominators on the Court

*   **Kyle Duke (#23):** The primary weapon. 22 points, 4-8 from deep, 6-6 from the line. Game-changing return.
*   **Malachi Robinson (#07):** Defensive specialist. 3 blocks, 3 steals. He shut down their interior.
*   **Javecckio Thomas (#05):** Efficient scoring with 10 points and a team-high 9 rebounds. He imposed his will.
*   **Andrew McConnell (#03):** 10 points, including 2 crucial threes, and 5 rebounds. Consistent veteran leadership.
*   **Tanner Walton (#04):** The glue guy. 5 assists, 3 steals, 1 block. Filling up the stat sheet.

### Areas for Immediate Correction

We're 10-0, but we're not satisfied with a perfect record. We demand perfect execution.

*   **Second Half Drop-Off:** Allowing them to win the second half by 13 points is unacceptable. We need to play a full 40 minutes of intense, disciplined basketball.
*   **Perimeter Defense:** While we held them to 6-for-18 from three overall, they shot 5-for-12 in the second half. We cannot allow teams to get comfortable from deep.
*   **Rebounding Battle:** We were slightly outrebounded 39-37. We need to win the glass every single night.

### What's Next

The Patriots return home on Friday to take on St. Mary Of The Woods.
