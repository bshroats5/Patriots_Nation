The Patriots turned around from a rough weekend and took some anger out on their rivals. From the links to pitch to the court the Patriots **DOMINATED** their opponents today. From a hole-in-one to a 12 goal performance on the pitch to another sweep from the volleyball program to a shutout on the pitch to finish the night.

## Golf Rocked The Links

Both Men's and Women's golf teams won their competitions at the East Tennessee Collegiate Tournament. The highlight was a hole-in-one completed by **Saran Jantratit** and **Ainslee Cruce** who missed the program record by three strokes.

At 16:07, **Tori Robertson** scored her first career collegiate goal off a cross from Evelyn Saldivar. Robertson wasn't done, as she scored an unassisted goal at 31:50 after dispossessing a defender to give the Patriots a comfortable 4-0 lead heading into halftime.

### Second Half: An Offensive Explosion (8-0)
