**WE ARE A FORCE! Patriots Roll to 4-0 After Erupting for 101 Points!**

We cruised to a massive 101-60 victory over Defiance, and it was a total team effort from start to finish. With **six of our players scoring in double figures** and our defense creating chaos, we showed just how dangerous we can be. This win keeps our perfect season rolling at 4-0!

### First Quarter: We Set the Tone with Tenacious Defense

From the opening tip, we were in attack mode. Amy Thompson, making her first collegiate start, set the tone immediately with a pair of beautiful assists to get us a quick 4-0 lead. Our defense was suffocating. We were jumping passing lanes, forcing turnovers, and turning them into easy buckets on the other end. After Defiance cut the lead to 15-7, we absolutely locked them down, ripping off a **9-0 run** fueled by our relentless pressure. We tallied **six steals** in the quarter alone! To cap off a dominant opening frame, Jaydyn Carrico finished a tough three-point play in the closing seconds, sending us into the second with a commanding **29-12 lead**.

### Second Quarter: Keeping Our Foot on the Gas

We didn't let up for a second. Joy Kendrick started the quarter by draining a three-pointer, and even when Defiance tried to make a run, we had an answer. Joy found Lakin Burke for a tough and-one to push our lead to 38-17. We were unstoppable in transition, getting back-to-back layups that had us cruising at 44-21. Our bench came in and provided a huge spark, with Mackenzie Babb draining a three and then getting a big-time block on the other end. We went into halftime with a comfortable **56-32 lead**, having firmly established our dominance.

### Third Quarter: Pulling Away for Good

We came out of the locker room determined to put the game away, and our defense led the charge once again. Noel Smith got a steal on one of the first possessions, leading to a transition three-pointer from Joy Kendrick. That play ignited a **7-0 run**, capped by a three from Aden Clark, that pushed our lead to 66-35. We were sharing the ball, playing for each other, and making the extra pass. Late in the quarter, Zaram Fredricks grabbed an offensive rebound and scored on the putback, and jumpers from Noel and Zaram in the final seconds sent us into the final frame with a massive **80-44 advantage**.

### Fourth Quarter: Hitting the Century Mark!

With the game well in hand, it was a chance for our entire roster to shine, and they did not disappoint. Zaram Fredricks scored three quick points to start the quarter, and even after a run from Defiance, we had the final say. We closed the game with a flurry, ripping off a **9-0 run** that was highlighted by a trio of points from Emily Naranjo. That final push got us over the century mark and put the finishing touches on a spectacular 101-60 victory.
