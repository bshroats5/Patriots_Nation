The #10 Cumberlands Patriots sent a message to the rest of the NAIA on Tuesday, traveling to Columbia, KY, and putting on a volleyball clinic to sweep their rival, #25 Lindsey Wilson, 3-0 (25-17, 25-13, 25-16). The dominant performance in the top-25 clash extends the Patriots' historic winning streak to 21 matches and marks their 16th consecutive sweep.

Cumberlands was simply on fire, hitting a sensational .398 as a team while holding the Blue Raiders to a meager .086 hitting percentage in a lopsided affair.

### Set 1: Serving and Swinging to an Early Lead

The Patriots set the tone from the service line, firing five aces in the opening frame to keep Lindsey Wilson off balance. The offense was equally potent, as **Sara Zampedri**, **Elaina Fischer**, and **Kara Gipson** consistently found the floor. A late push, powered by UC's relentless attack, allowed the Patriots to pull away for a comfortable 25-17 win.

### Set 2: An Offensive Explosion

Cumberlands found another gear in the second set, overwhelming the Blue Raiders with an offensive onslaught. The Patriots hit a scorching .444 in the frame, putting down 19 kills with just three errors. **Savanah Jolly** expertly distributed the ball to all her hitters, with **Zampedri** and **Brynnley Bryant** leading the charge. The defense was just as sharp, holding Lindsey Wilson in check and cruising to a dominant 25-13 victory.

### Set 3: Closing Out the Rivalry Sweep

With a commanding 2-0 lead, the Patriots left no doubt in the final set. They jumped out to an early lead and never let up. Every time the Blue Raiders tried to mount a comeback, Cumberlands had an answer. A pair of aces from **Davey Slaughter** midway through the set helped extend the lead, and a final kill from **Brynnley Bryant** sealed the 25-16 win and the emphatic sweep over their ranked rival.

### Patriots By The Numbers

*   **Leading the Attack:** **Sara Zampedri** was the top offensive player on the court, finishing with a match-high 13 kills to go with 8 digs and 3 aces.
