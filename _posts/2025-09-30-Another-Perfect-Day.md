Alright, pop a squat, grab a Dr.Pepper Let's break down these HUGE wins for the Patriots.

### **First up, the Soccer Game: PATRIOTS 1, SCAD 0**

**LET'S GOOOOO!** Another top-10 matchup, another **W** in the books. That's just how we do it. Number 2 vs. Number 9? Please. It was never in doubt.

We came out firing, didn't even give 'em a chance to breathe. Just six minutes in, **Nicole Araujo** does her thing down the side, sends a wicked cross into the box and BOOM! **Alba Ramirez** is right there to do her job and put it in the back of the net. Her **FIRST** of the season! Ya love to see it!

Yeah, we almost made it 2-0 a couple times—pinged one off the crossbar, another off the post—but you know what wins championships? **DEFENSE**. Our backline was a brick wall, and our goalie, **Morgan White**? Forget about it. They threw everything they had at her in the second half and she just stood there, turning 'em all away. A total of **four saves, a clean sheet**, no days off for that kid.

They got a little chippy at the end, we picked up a few cards, but that's what happens when you can't hang. We just managed the clock, locked it down, and took care of business. That's Patriots football—I mean, soccer.

Good win. *We're on to Lindsey Wilson.*

### **Next, the Volleyball Game: PATRIOTS 3, GEORGETOWN 0**

Are you kidding me?! If you thought the soccer game was a win, this was a straight-up **DEMOLITION**. A complete and total domination. Georgetown showed up, I guess. The scoreboard says they did.

We just dismantled 'em. **3-0 sweep. 25-13, 25-10, 25-19.** It wasn't even that close.

Look at these numbers. We hit **.463** on the attack. They hit **.054**. That's not a typo, kid. That's called a beatdown. **Sara Zampedri** was an absolute **MONSTER** out there—**13 kills, 10 digs**, just a force of nature. **Brynnley Bryant** and **Alana Shiery** were hammering nails all night, too.

And how about **Savanah Jolly**? **30 assists!** Just dishing out dimes like Brady in the pocket, setting everyone up for success.

Forty-seven kills for us, 23 for them. Four blocks for us, **ZERO** for them. We were better in every single part of the game. This is what a championship-caliber team looks like. Perfect record, **17-0**. Still undefeated. Still the team to beat.

We have now won 12 straight by sweeps and 39 straight sets won by the Patriots!

Another one in the win column. Business as usual. **LET'S GOOOO**
