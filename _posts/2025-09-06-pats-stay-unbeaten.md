# No. 5 Patriots Take Down No. 11 Indiana Wesleyan in Home Opener

The fifth-ranked University of the Cumberlands women’s soccer team rose to the occasion in their home opener, using a second-half goal and a stout defensive effort to defeat 11th-ranked Indiana Wesleyan 1-0 Saturday afternoon at the UC Soccer Complex. The victory moves the Patriots to **4-0-2** on the season while handing the Wildcats their first loss at **4-1-0**. The win also marked UC’s second straight result over a top-12 opponent.  

## Match Summary  

### First Half: Evenly Contested  
Both sides came out ready for a high-level matchup. In the opening minutes, **Nicole Araujo** and **Carola Fontan** generated early looks for Cumberlands, while Indiana Wesleyan tested goalkeeper **Morgan White** with a shot on frame in the 8th minute. White calmly made the stop to keep the match level.  

Fontan continued to create chances, firing two more shots midway through the half, both of which were turned away by the Wildcats’ defense. The two sides traded possession in the middle third of the field for much of the period, with each recording a shot and a save before heading into halftime locked in a scoreless draw.  

### Second Half: Long Delivers the Breakthrough  
Cumberlands came out more aggressive after the break, immediately pushing numbers forward and earning two early looks that went just wide. The pressure paid off in the **53rd minute**, when UC earned their first corner kick of the game.

UC kept pressing as **Letizia Traversone** and Fontan each had shots over the next five minutes, but neither found the back of the net. Indiana Wesleyan responded by pushing forward in search of the equalizer. The Patriots’ defense, anchored by Sokolove, Long, **Noah Paalman**, and **Karla Waibel**, held firm and denied the Wildcats meaningful chances.
