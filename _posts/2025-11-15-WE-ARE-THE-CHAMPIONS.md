### 34-0. We Are Champions. The Job Is Done.

We came here with one objective: to finish what we started. Today, we executed. We are the Mid-South Conference Tournament Champions. We faced a tough, disciplined Campbellsville team that tested our resolve, but we responded the way champions do, securing a 3-1 victory (25-17, 25-21, 22-25, 25-15) to keep our perfect season alive. 34 games, 34 wins. This wasn't just another match; this was for the title, and we left no doubt who the best team is.

### First Set: We Made a Statement

There was no feeling-out process. We came out and imposed our will from the first serve. We were a machine, operating with near-perfect efficiency. We put down **17 kills on just one single error, hitting an astronomical .516** as a team. We controlled the net, we controlled the pace, and we sent a clear message. This was our court. We took the set 25-17 and never looked back.

### Second Set: We Showed Our Grit

The second set was a dogfight. It wasn't pretty. Both teams battled for every point, trading blows back and forth. Our execution wasn't as sharp, but this is where championship habits take over. We dug in, we made the hustle plays, and when the set was on the line, we found a way to win. It's not always about dominating; it's about finding a way to get the job done when things aren't perfect. We gutted out a 25-21 win.

### Third & Fourth Sets: We Answered the Bell

We had a lapse in the third set. Give Campbellsville credit; they played their best volleyball and out-executed us. They rattled us and set us back temporarily. They took the set. That was their best shot. Our response? A complete and total shutdown in the fourth. We came out with a level of focus and intensity that they could not match. We dominated from start to finish, hitting .333 with only two errors and holding them to just .097. We didn't just win the fourth set 25-15; we made a declaration. That is how you answer adversity.

### Our Champions of the Court

*   **Sara Zampedri:** An absolutely dominant performance from our primary weapon. She was unstoppable, leading the charge with a match-high **18 kills on a .356 hitting percentage** and terrorizing them from the service line with **4 aces**. She did her job at an elite level.
*   **Savanah Jolly:** The field general. She orchestrated the entire offense, distributing the ball with precision for **48 assists**. She made everyone around her better.
*   **The Defensive Anchors:** **Autiana Wilson** and **Davey Slaughter** were a wall in the back row. They refused to let anything hit the floor, combining for an incredible **40 digs** (20 each).
*   **Alana Shiery:** The enforcer at the net. She was a constant physical presence, contributing **8 kills** on an efficient .333 clip and leading the team with **4 total blocks**.

### By the Numbers

*   **Serving Pressure:** We won the service battle decisively, posting **9 aces to their 3**. We were the aggressors all afternoon.
*   **Offensive Efficiency:** We were the more disciplined, more effective offense, winning the hitting percentage battle **.275 to .196**.
*   **Winning the Big Moments:** We scored **70.0 points to their 67.0**. In a championship match, every single point matters, and we won more of them.
