<p> The #8 UC Patriots returned back to the W column tonight after a second half goal by Nicole Araujo and a heroic save by Freshman Morgan White at the death to preserve the win. </p>
<h2> The First Half </h2>
<p> The Pats would get off 13 goals in the first half to Milligan only getting one goal off in the first half. UC would get 5 corner kicks in the first half while Milligan would get just one and that would be their only corner kick in the match.  </p>

<h2> The Second Half </h2>
<p> UC would not let off the gas in the second half determined to get a goal on the board and bring home the win. They would do that in the 50th minute when Araujo would head the ball past the Buffaloes Goalkeeper Emily Robinson after an assist from Sara Soto. Robinson would have a great match overall with 9 saves total.

The Buffaloes had one last shot in the final seconds of the match as they headed a ball on target but the freshman keeper made the save and the Patriots would win 1-0 on the road.

<h2> What is next for UC </h2>

<p>The road gets tougher for the Pats as they will travel to Michigan to take on #10 Spring Arbor on Saturday at 3 PM. Since 2023 UC has beaten Spring Arbor twice including in the NAIA Final 4 matchup in 2023. One year ago Spring Arbor came down to Kentucky and left with a 3-1 loss. All time UC leads the series 2-0-1.
