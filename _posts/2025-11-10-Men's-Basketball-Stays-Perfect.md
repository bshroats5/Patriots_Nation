### 6-0. We Are Undefeated.

We went on the road and did our job. This was a business trip, and we walked out of their gym with a 96-84 victory over Johnson to keep our perfect season alive. We're 6-0. We're executing the game plan. This wasn't just another win; it was another step towards the standard we demand of ourselves.

### First Half: We Set the Tone

From the opening tip, we made it clear we were there to dominate. We unleashed an offensive storm, starting the game on an **18-4 run** that left them scrambling for answers. The ball was moving, our shots were falling, and we were playing our brand of basketball. Kyle Duke and Andrew McConnell came out firing, and the whole team followed suit. We dropped **59 points** in the first half alone, hitting over 50% from the field and from three. We went into the locker room with a 21-point lead and total control.

### Second Half: We Answered the Bell

Give Johnson credit. They didn't roll over. They came out of the half and made their run, trying to fight their way back into the game. This is where you find out what a team is made of. When they pushed, we pushed back harder. Every time they tried to close the gap, one of our guys stepped up to make a play. Whether it was a clutch bucket from Duke, a dagger three-pointer from Brant Smithers, or a key defensive stop, we had an answer. We never panicked. We absorbed their best punch and finished the job.

### The Executioners: Our Stars of the Night

*   **Kyle Duke:** The undisputed leader and an absolute force. He dropped a game-high **31 points** on an incredibly efficient 12-of-19 shooting, adding **3 steals** to impact the game on both ends of the floor.
*   **Brant Smithers:** The definition of "next man up." He was instant offense off the bench, pouring in **20 points** and lighting it up from deep, hitting **6 of his 9 three-point attempts**.
*   **The Sharpshooters:** As a unit, we were dialed in from beyond the arc. We drained **15 threes at a scorching 55.6% clip**, stretching their defense and breaking their will.
*   **Malachi Robinson:** Controlled the paint and the glass, pulling down **7 boards** (4 offensive) and showing his toughness inside.

### By the Numbers

*   **Shooting Efficiency:** We controlled the game by controlling our shots, winning the field goal battle **54.7% to 44.3%**.
*   **Dominance from Deep:** We owned the three-point line, outshooting them **55.6% to 30.8%**.
*   **Controlling the Glass:** We won the rebounding war **38 to 29**, limiting their second chances.
*   **Capitalizing on Mistakes:** We forced turnovers and turned them into points, scoring **18 points off their 8 turnovers**.
