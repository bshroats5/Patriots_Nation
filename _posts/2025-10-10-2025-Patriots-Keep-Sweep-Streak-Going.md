The #10 Cumberlands Patriots volleyball team continues to rewrite the history books, putting on an offensive clinic Friday evening to sweep Bethel University 3-0 (25-11, 25-11, 25-16). The victory not only marks their 14th consecutive sweep but also ties the program's all-time record for consecutive wins, pushing their perfect season record to 19-0.

The Patriots' offense was simply on another level, hitting a jaw-dropping .438 as a team while suffocating the Wildcats and holding them to a .077 clip.

### Set 1: Patriots Overwhelm Wildcats Early

Cumberlands wasted no time asserting its dominance, storming out to a 7-2 lead behind early kills from **Sara Zampedri** and **Brynnley Bryant** to force a quick Bethel timeout. The onslaught continued as **Kara Gipson** took over at the net, powering a 9-2 run that put the set out of reach. The Patriots cruised to a 25-11 win to take the early advantage.

### Set 2: A Carbon Copy of Dominance

The second frame was more of the same as the Patriots' balanced attack proved to be too much to handle. **Brynnley Bryant** and **Alana Shiery** were unstoppable, combining for eight kills in the set. The offense ran smoothly through setter **Savanah Jolly**, who kept the defense guessing all night. A 6-1 run, capped by a service ace from **Autiana Wilson**, sealed another 25-11 victory and a 2-0 match lead.

### Set 3: Sealing the Deal and Making History

Bethel showed some fight early in the third, keeping the score close through the first ten points. However, the Patriots quickly squashed any hope of a comeback, unleashing a massive 10-2 run fueled by **Sara Zampedri** and **Kara Gipson** to break the set wide open. Late kills from **Elaina Fischer** and **Bryant** officially closed the door, securing the 25-16 win and the historic victory.
