The #8 women's soccer team opened its 2025 campaign with a commanding 5-0 win over Missouri Baptist University.  

Abigail Little, Juan Fernandez Calvo, Carola Fontan, Nicole Araujo, and Wakana Ose all scored in the first half.  

The Patriots fired 23 shots (11 on goal) and preserved a clean sheet behind goalkeepers Morgan White (81′) and Ella Gilliam (9′).  

Meanwhile, the #4 men’s soccer team drew 1-1 on the road at Grace College. Samuel Dolobaipu netted the lone Pats goal.  

NAIA pre-season rankings also placed both men’s and women’s cross-country programs at #4 nationally—the highest women’s preseason mark ever. Both teams open next Friday at the Berea College Jamboree.
