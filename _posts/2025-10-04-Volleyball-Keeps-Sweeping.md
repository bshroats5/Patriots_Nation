The freight train that is the #10 ranked Cumberlands Patriots volleyball team kept rolling Saturday morning, extending its incredible run of dominance with another convincing sweep. The Patriots traveled to Lebanon, TN, and defeated Cumberland University 3-0 (25-19, 25-19, 25-13) to continue their perfect season.

The win marks the Patriots' 13th consecutive sweep as they remain unbeaten at 18-0 overall and 4-0 in Mid-South Conference play. They have also won 42 straight sets. The team was a model of efficiency, hitting .308 on the attack while holding the Phoenix to just .109.

Set 1: Phoenix Tested, Patriots Prevail
The opening set was a battle early on, with six ties and three lead changes as the Phoenix tried to keep pace. But trailing 13-12, the Patriots found another gear, unleashing a 6-1 run powered by kills from Sara Zampedri and Kara Gipson to take control. Leading 20-17, UC slammed the door shut with a pair of kills from Brynnley Bryant and a crucial ace from Savanah Jolly to seal the 25-19 win.

Set 2: Zampedri Takes Over
The second frame followed a similar script, with both teams trading blows in a tight contest through the midway point. Thatâ€™s when Sara Zampedri simply took over, rattling off three straight thunderous kills to give the Pats a 15-11 lead they would not surrender. Savanah Jolly and Alana Shiery added a key block down the stretch, and Zampedri fittingly ended the set with a powerful cross-court kill for another 25-19 victory.

Set 3: A Dominant Finish
With a 2-0 lead, the Patriots left no doubt in the third and final set. They exploded out of the gate to a massive 11-4 advantage, thanks to the tough serving of Savanah Jolly and two early kills from Kara Gipson. The Phoenix had no answer for the relentless UC offense, which hit a blistering .391 in the frame. A late 5-1 run, highlighted by back-to-back kills from Zampedri, sealed the 25-13 win and the match.

Sara Zampedri: Led the charge with a massive double-double, recording 17 kills on a phenomenal .441 hitting clip to go along with 10 digs and 2 aces.
