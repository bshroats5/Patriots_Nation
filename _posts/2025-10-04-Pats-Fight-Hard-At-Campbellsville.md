The Patriots (3-2) went into hostile territory on Saturday but could not pull off the upset vs # 12 Campbellsville Tigers (5-0). The 2 teams would go back and forth all day but the Tigers got the last punches in for the knockout.

# Explosive 1st Quarter

The Tigers wasted zero time getting on the board taking the opening kickoff to the house for an early 7-0 lead. The Patriots first drive would stall out and they would punt the ball back. The Tigers would then complete a 52 yard run for a 14-0 lead just 2 minutes and 5 seconds into the game. 

The Patriots would respond back with a 67 yard pass from **Drew Gregg** to **DK Edwards** to vut the lead down to 14-7 still less than 3 minutes into the game. Later in the first quarter, **Jayden Clayton** would ram it in the endzone to tie the game at 14 all. 

# Second Quarter Didn't Let Up

Five minutes into the second, Campbellsville would break out a 55 yard run to retake the lead 21-14. The fireworks would take a break but they were not done. 

**Maddux McKinley** would catch a 25 yard TD pass from Greg to level the score once again at 21-21. That tie would last 20 seconds after a 41 yard TD pass for the Tigers for a 28-21 lead. One minute and three seconds later the Patriots **Cade Lamb** would catch a 4 yard pass from Gregg. It appeared the Pats were going to tie the game going into the half but disaster struck. The Extra Point would be blocked and momentum went from UC to CU going into the halftime break.

### Tigers Pull Away in a Turnover-Filled Second Half
Coming out of the break down by a single point, the Patriots looked to seize the momentum that was lost on the blocked extra point. However, the third quarter turned into a defensive slugfest, a stark contrast to the offensive fireworks of the first half.

### Third Quarter Grind
The second half began with both defenses stepping up, forcing a series of punts from each offense. The Patriots got a huge break midway through the quarter when ***Jeremy Hamilton*** intercepted a pass to give Cumberlands the ball in Tiger territory. Unfortunately, the offense couldn't capitalize on the turnover and was forced to punt once again.

Campbellsville finally broke the defensive stalemate late in the quarter. The Tigers mounted an impressive 9-play, 90-yard drive, capped off by a 33-yard touchdown pass to Tre' Bass, his third score of the day. This was the lone score of the quarter, extending the Tiger lead to 35-27 heading into the final frame.

### A Wild Fourth Quarter Finish
The Patriots began the fourth quarter with a promising drive, moving the ball deep into Campbellsville territory. But disaster struck again as Drew Gregg was intercepted, thwarting a potential scoring drive. After forcing a punt, the Patriots' hopes took a massive hit when the Tigers scored on the very next playâ€”a 48-yard touchdown pass to the unstoppable ***Tre' Bass*** to make it 42-27.

Refusing to quit, the Patriots answered right back. Drew Gregg connected with **Michael Petty** for a 47-yard touchdown, pulling UC back within one score at 42-34 with just over four minutes to play.

The Patriots' defense gave them one last chance, with **Major Newman** coming up with an interception to give the offense the ball with 2:10 on the clock. However, the comeback was not to be. Just two plays later, a pass was intercepted for the second time by the Tigers. On the very next drive, Campbellsville put the final nail in the coffin, breaking free for a 50-yard touchdown run, his fifth of the game. A final Patriots drive would end in a fumble, allowing the Tigers to kneel out the clock and secure the victory.

### Final Score: Cumberlands 34 Campbellsville 49

## A Record-Breaking Day for Gregg
Despite the final score, it was a historic day for quarterback Drew Gregg. In one of the greatest passing performances in program history, Gregg shattered single-game records for completions (33), attempts (62), and passing yards (425), while also throwing four touchdowns. The previous marks had stood for 25 years and were ironically set against the very same Campbellsville Tigers back in 2000. Gregg also proved to be a threat on the ground, adding 30 rushing yards to his remarkable stat line.

## On Deck

Next up for the Patriots is another tough road game at # 7 Lindsey Wilson.
