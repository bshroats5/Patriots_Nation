# Patriots Dominate Homecoming, Rout #25 Bethel 34-10

The Cumberlands Patriots put on a complete performance for the Homecoming crowd Saturday night, snapping a three-game skid with a dominant 34-10 victory over #25 Bethel. The Patriots controlled the game from start to finish, racking up over 400 yards of offense and suffocating the Wildcats' attack to earn their first win over Bethel since 2021.

### Ground and Pound Powers Fast Start

The Patriots established their physical dominance early, with the running back duo of **Jayden Clayton** and **Juan Bullard Jr.** leading the charge. After the defense forced a turnover on downs on Bethel's opening drive, **Drew Gregg** connected with **Ronye Watson** for a 39-yard gain, setting up a 6-yard touchdown run by **Bullard Jr.** On the very next possession, a **Jalen Yearby** interception gave the ball right back to the offense. **Clayton** immediately ripped off a 52-yard run, and **Bullard Jr.** punched it in from nine yards out to give the Patriots a 13-0 lead.

### Offense Keeps Rolling, Defense Slams the Door

After a Bethel field goal, the Patriots answered with their longest drive of the night—a methodical 12-play, 65-yard march. A 32-yard strike to **Maddux McKinney** and a crucial fourth-down conversion by **Gregg** set up a one-yard touchdown pass to **Eli Davis**, extending the lead to 20-3 at halftime.

The momentum continued into the third quarter. **Gregg** found **Michael Petty** for 39 yards and then hit **DK Edwards** for an incredible one-handed, 11-yard touchdown catch to make it 27-3. Bethel managed its only touchdown of the game, but the Patriots responded immediately. **Bullard Jr.** broke a tackle for a 23-yard gain and then scored his third touchdown of the night to put the game away at 34-10. From there, the defense took over, led by **Jaquon Hall** who finished with three sacks. The Patriots forced punts on Bethel's final four drives to seal the victory.

### Patriots By The Numbers

*   **Touchdown Machine:** **Juan Bullard Jr.** was unstoppable, finishing with 66 rushing yards and a hat-trick of 3 touchdowns.
*   **Explosive Runner:** **Jayden Clayton** led the ground attack with a game-high 102 yards on just 11 carries.

*   **Total Domination:** The Patriots were a perfect 5-for-5 in the red zone and held Bethel to just 3-of-15 on third down.
