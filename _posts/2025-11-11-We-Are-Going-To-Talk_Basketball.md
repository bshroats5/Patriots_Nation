**The Women's Soccer Teams Comes Short**

The Patriots fell in OT to the Campbellsville in the MSC Final. They will find out if they will play in the NAIA Tourney 11/14. That's all we need to say about that. In our best Bill Bellicheck voice "We're onto basketball"

### 7-0. We Handled Our Business.

Another road game, another win. We went into a hostile environment and executed the game plan. The final score was 91-62. We did our job, improved to 7-0, and now we move on. It was a professional performance, but there are always details to correct.

### The Second Quarter: We Imposed Our Will

The first quarter was a feeling-out process. We ended it with a six-point lead. The second quarter is where we put the game away. That's our brand of basketball. We turned up the defensive intensity and locked them down, holding them to just **8 points**. Our offense fed off that energy, and we put up 26. We turned a close game into a 53-29 halftime lead. The game was decided right there. That ten-minute stretch is the standard we expect.

### The Execution Report: How We Won The Game

This was a victory built on fundamentals: toughness, defense, and controlling what we can control.

*   **We Owned the Glass:** This is non-negotiable. We dominated the rebounding battle, pulling down **56 total boards**. The key number is **22 offensive rebounds**. That's pure effort. That's creating second and third chances for yourself while demoralizing the opponent. You win the glass, you win the game.
*   **Dominance in the Paint:** Our game plan was to attack the interior, and we executed it. We pounded the ball inside, scoring on layups and put-backs all night. This was a direct result of our rebounding advantage.
*   **Defensive Pressure:** We generated offense from our defense. We forced them into mistakes and capitalized, collecting **13 steals** as a team. Active hands, good positioning. That's how you create easy buckets.

### Individual Performance Review

Everyone has a job to do. These individuals executed their roles at a high level.

*   **Zaram Fredricks (#14):** An absolute monster on the boards. She did her job, pulling down **15 rebounds** (5 offensive) and adding **3 blocks**. She controlled the paint from start to finish. A dominant physical performance. SHe now leads UC in All-Time Blocks.
*   **Jaydyn Carrico (#03):** Led the offensive attack. An efficient **21 points** to go along with **7 rebounds** and **4 assists**. She filled the stat sheet and was a consistent offensive threat.
*   **Lakin Burke (#20):** The definition of efficiency. In just **15 minutes** of play, she put up **17 points** and grabbed **8 rebounds** (6 offensive). She provided a massive spark and made the most of every single second she was on the floor.
*   **Darcie Anderson (#02):** The floor general. She facilitated the offense with **4 assists** and set the tone on defense with **3 steals** and a block.

### Areas for Correction

We're not satisfied. A win is the expectation, but perfection is the goal.

*   **Three-Point Shooting:** 4-for-19 (21.1%). Not good enough. We have to be better from the perimeter.
*   **Turnovers:** We had 17. That's too many. We have to value the basketball on every possession.
*   **Free Throws:** 67.9%. We left points on the board. Unacceptable. That comes down to focus and repetition.

## Next Up
