Both Patriots soccer programs competed in the Mid-South Conference Semi-Finals tonight and only one advanced the the conference Finals. The women Patriots beat 2 seed Lindsey Wilson 3-2. On the other end the top seeded Patriots fell to the red hot 4 seed Cumberland Phoenix 2-0. They will have to wait and see if they are given an at-large bid into the NAIA tournament.

### First Half Breakdown: We Came Out Firing

From the opening whistle, we made it clear this was our game to win. We were relentless in the attack, controlling possession and peppering their goal with shots. Their keeper was forced into making save after save as Abigail Little, Laura Bosca, and Maliah Mitchell all tested her early. We were knocking on the door, and it was only a matter of time before we broke through.

Our constant pressure finally paid off in the 8th minute. Maliah Mitchell fired a great shot that their keeper managed to parry away, but **Sara Soto** was an absolute predator, crashing the net and smashing home the rebound to give us the massive 1-0 lead! The energy was electric. We didn't sit back after scoring; we kept pushing, outshooting them 12-6 in the first half and holding a 7-1 advantage in shots on goal. We went into the locker room with a well-deserved lead, knowing we had dominated the first 45 minutes.

### Second Half Breakdown: A Rollercoaster of Heart and Guts

We came out of the locker room looking to put the game away, and it started perfectly. Just six minutes into the half, Laura Bosca sent a perfect ball in, and **Abigail Little** was there for a brilliant finish. We were flying high with a 2-0 lead, and it felt like we had all the momentum.

But a rival like Lindsey Wilson never goes away. They found a goal in the 58th minute to cut our lead in half, and you could feel the tension rise across the field. This was the moment that defined our victory. How did we respond?

Immediately. Emphatically. Just three minutes later, **Abigail Little** decided she was not going to be denied, finding the back of the net for her second goal of the game to put us right back up 3-1! It was a championship-level response when we needed it most.

The chaos continued as the Blue Raiders scored again just moments later, setting up a nail-biting, heart-stopping final 28 minutes. They threw everything they had at us—corners, long balls, you name it. We nearly sealed it when Carola Fontan rattled a shot off the post. But our backline was a brick wall. They bent, but they never, ever broke. Maliah Mitchell, Samantha Sokolove, Madison Long, and Karla Waibel were absolute warriors, clearing every ball and protecting our lead until that beautiful final whistle blew.
