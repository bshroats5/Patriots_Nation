**We Put on a SHOW! Patriots Erupt for 102 Points in Dominant Home Win!**

We defended our home court in style tonight, putting on an offensive clinic to cruise past WVU Tech with a massive 102-75 victory! We were firing on all cylinders, sharing the ball, and playing with an energy that was simply unstoppable. When we play like this, we're a tough team to beat.

### First Half Breakdown: We Weathered Their Storm, Then Unleashed Ours

The game started as a back-and-forth battle. WVU Tech came out hot, and we found ourselves trading buckets with them early on. They took a brief 16-13 lead midway through the half, but we didn't flinch. That's when we decided to take over the game.

Sparked by a jumper from Javecckio Thomas and a three-pointer from Andrew McConnell, we ripped off a **14-2 run** that completely flipped the script and put us in control at 27-18. Our defense locked in, creating turnovers, and our offense was electric. Kyle Duke was absolutely on fire, hitting three after three, while Anthony Harris and Javecckio Thomas were dominating the paint. We shot an incredible **52.8%** from the field and hit **seven threes** in the first half alone. By the time the buzzer sounded, we had turned a small deficit into a commanding **49-32 lead** at halftime.

### Second Half Breakdown: We Dropped the Hammer

We came out of the locker room determined to leave no doubt, and we did just that. We opened the second half with an offensive explosion, going on a jaw-dropping **24-9 run** to blow the game wide open. It was a total team effort. Kyle Duke stayed hot from deep, Anthony Harris was throwing down dunks, Brady Bell got in on the action, and our defense was suffocating. Before they knew what hit them, our lead had swelled to a game-high 32 points at 73-41.

From there, it was all about our depth. Our bench came in and didn't miss a beat, continuing to push the pace and score. Ikemba Otuonye was an absolute force off the bench, pouring in 16 points and showing just how many weapons we have. We never took our foot off the gas, hitting the century mark and finishing the game with a statement victory.
