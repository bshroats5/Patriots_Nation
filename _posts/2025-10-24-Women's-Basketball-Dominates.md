The #25 Cumberlands Patriots women's basketball team opened their season in spectacular fashion, putting on a defensive clinic that fueled an offensive explosion in a 114-64 dismantling of Simmons College. The Patriots forced an incredible 28 steals and showcased their depth with five players scoring in double figures in the dominant victory on Randy Vernon Court.

### A Fast and Furious Start

The Patriots set the tone from the opening tip, overwhelming the Falcons with a blistering 14-0 run to start the game. The defensive pressure was relentless from the very first possession, as **Darcie Anderson** came up with a steal and converted a three-point play. That was just the beginning, as UC forced four straight steals that led to four consecutive baskets, pushing the lead to 12-0 in just over a minute of play. **Zaram Fredricks** capped the run with a putback, and the Patriots never looked back, taking a 28-15 lead after the first quarter.

### Bench Provides a Spark in the Second

The pressure didn't let up in the second quarter, as the Patriots' depth took over. **Joy Kendrick** and newcomer **Jaydyn Carrico** combined for the first eight points of a run that extended the lead to 40-17. The hustle was on full display midway through the quarter when **Peyton Mounce** dove on the floor for a loose ball, starting a fast break that ended with an **Aden Clark** pass to **Carrico** for the finish. The Patriots took a commanding 53-28 lead into the halftime break.

### No Let-Up After Halftime

Any thoughts of a comeback were quickly erased as the Patriots opened the second half with another massive 14-0 run. **Joy Kendrick** and **Aden Clark** each drained three-pointers during the surge, blowing the game wide open. The steals continued to pile up, leading to easy transition points as the Patriots built an insurmountable 80-43 lead heading into the final frame.

### Surpassing the Century Mark

The fourth quarter was a victory lap for the Patriots as they cruised to the finish line. A layup from **Zaram Fredricks** pushed the lead to 97-56, and a few moments later, back-to-back layups from **Clark** and **Anderson** put the Patriots over the 100-point mark for the second consecutive season. In a special moment, **Noel Smith** sank her first collegiate bucket, and the Patriots closed out the impressive 114-64 win.
