The Patriots remained undefeated on the pitch and court. The #5 Soccer team batteled hard to a 2-1 win in Miami against St. Thomas. Meanwhile here in Kentucky the #20 Volleyball team swept the Boyce Bulldogs.

# Late-Game Heroics Lift Cumberlands Past St. Thomas, 2-1  

Under the humid South Florida sun, the University of the Cumberlands women’s soccer team stretched its unbeaten streak to seven games with a dramatic **2-1 victory** over St. Thomas at AutoNation Field.  

The game was a tale of pressure versus precision. St. Thomas dominated stretches of play, outshooting Cumberlands 12–7 and forcing goalkeeper **Morgan White** into **10 saves**, but the Patriots capitalized on their few clear opportunities — thanks to the brilliance of sophomore forward **Wakana Ose**.  

---

## First Half: Surviving Pressure  
The opening 45 minutes were a test of endurance for the Patriots’ back line. The Bobcats peppered White with shots — including a pair of early strikes from **Julia Ezcurra** — but the keeper stood tall. While St. Thomas held the edge in corners and shots, Cumberlands’ defenders held their line, keeping the score 0–0 at halftime.  

---

## Second Half: Ose Breaks Through  
Just three minutes into the second half, the Patriots finally found their opening. A crisp build-up between midfielders **Laura Bosca** and **Kayah Robbins** freed Ose inside the box. With one touch, she slotted the ball past keeper **Isabella Peñaranda** in the 49th minute for a 1–0 lead.  

St. Thomas responded with relentless pressure. Their breakthrough came in the 71st minute when **Carolina de Vega** whipped in a dangerous ball from a corner. Ezcurra pounced, finishing clinically to tie the match 1–1. The momentum shifted, and the Bobcats appeared poised to complete their comeback as wave after wave of attacks tested White once more.  

---

## Final Blow: Ose Strikes Again  
The deadlock held until late in the match, when the Patriots turned defense into lightning-fast offense. In the 88th minute, substitute **Carola Fontan** slid a perfectly weighted pass into space. Ose, making a clever diagonal run, struck her second goal of the game — her **third of the season** — silencing the Bobcat fans and sending her teammates roaring onto the field.  

White made two more crucial saves in the closing minutes, including a diving stop on a point-blank header from Ezcurra, preserving the 2-1 win.

## Stat Recap  
- **Shots (On Goal):** STU 12 (11), UC 7 (5)  
- **Saves:** UC’s White 10, STU’s Peñaranda 3  
- **Corners:** STU 4, UC 2  
- **Fouls:** UC 9, STU 6  

---

## What It Means  
For the Patriots, the win keeps them **undefeated at 5-0-2**, solidifying their reputation as a resilient team that thrives under pressure. Ose has emerged as their clutch performer, while Morgan White proved again why she is one of the conference’s top goalkeepers.  

For St. Thomas, the loss was a frustrating story of missed chances. Despite controlling much of the match, the Bobcats (3-2-1) lacked the finishing edge that Cumberlands displayed on limited opportunities.  

As the final whistle blew, it became clear: this was a match defined by efficiency, heart, and Wakana Ose’s killer instinct in front of net.  

# Cumberlands Dominates Boyce in Straight Sets, Extends Perfect Start to 12-0  

The University of the Cumberlands volleyball team showed why it remains undefeated, rolling past Boyce College in **straight sets (25-9, 25-10, 25-17)** to improve to a perfect **12-0** on the season.  

Boyce, still searching for its first win, struggled against Cumberlands’ size and efficiency at the net. Ultimately, the Patriots hit **.475 as a team** while holding Boyce to **-.097**, a clear illustration of how one-sided the match was.

## Set 1: A Statement Start  
Cumberlands wasted no time in taking command of the match. With perfectly placed sets from **Savanah Jolly** (who finished with **35 assists**), the Patriots’ hitters overwhelmed Boyce. **Sara Zampedri** and **Kara Gipson** combined for five kills in the opening run as UC stormed out to a double-digit lead.  

The Patriots hit an eye-popping **.542 in the set** while committing **no attack errors**, cruising to a convincing **25-9** opening win.  

---

## Set 2: Relentless Efficiency  
The second frame looked much the same. Behind a balanced attack led by Zampedri and **Brynnley Bryant**, UC built momentum early and never looked back.  

Zampedri’s precision hitting (**9 kills, .692 hitting percentage**) and Gipson’s dominance in the middle (**8 kills, .636**) kept Boyce on the defensive. **Autiana Wilson’s three service aces** added to the pressure, igniting the 25-10 rout.  

---

## Set 3: Closing the Door  
Boyce showed its most resistance in the final set, as **Elyse Rau** and **Avery Green** helped the Bulldogs tally some quality rallies, combining for 11 of Boyce’s 15 total kills. However, UC answered every surge with depth off the bench.  

Contributions from **Faith Franklin** (2 kills, .667 pct.) and **Elaina Fischer** (5 kills, .833 pct.) showcased the Patriots’ depth, while **Alana Shiery** led the defense with **4 blocks**. UC sealed the sweep with a 25-17 win, finishing the night with smooth consistency across the court.
