A match that both teams can make an argument that they should had left with a Win ends in a 1-1 draw between two very good teams. 

### **Game Recap: PATRIOTS 1, GGC 1**

Alright, so it wasn't a W, but you know what this was? A **BATTLE**. A down-and-dirty, knock-down, drag-out fight on the road, and we didn't blink.

They got us in the first half, gotta give 'em that. Caught us sleepin' for a second around the 28-minute mark and put one in the net. You could tell it was gonna be a chippy oneâ€”cards flyin', fouls everywhere. But you think that's gonna slow us down? Please.

We came out of the half with a purpose. We started pressuring, controlling the ball, and just daring them to keep up. You could feel it coming. Then, around the 64-minute mark, the breakthrough! **Samuel Dolobaipu** finds the back of the net to tie this thing up! **THE EQUALIZER!** That's the grit, that's the heart you wanna see!

From there on out, it was all us. We outshot 'em 9-5 for the game, had more corners, and kept their keeper busy while ours could've taken a nap. They were just holding on for dear life at the end. We walk outta there with a point. We'll take it. Showed some real toughness coming back from down a goal.

Tough game, tough result, but we don't quit. *On to the next one.* **LET'S GOOOO.**
