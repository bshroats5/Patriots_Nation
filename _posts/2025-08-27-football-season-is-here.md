<p> It's the most wonderful time of the year as college football is back. The season returns for UC earlier than most teams as the UC Patriots kick off the season Thursday night at 7 PM in a big time rivalry match against Union Commonwealth. 
</p>

<h2> Game 1 </h2>

<p>The season kicks off against Union Commonwealth University as they battle for the Brass Lantern. These teams have met 16 times and UC has won 13 of those contests. Most famously in 2019 when the Patriots beat the Bulldogs 98-0. Union has not beaten UC since 2016. The three times they have beaten UC has been by a combined six points. This rivalry has been dominated by the Patriots and I do not see that changing tomorrow night in Barbourville. </p>

<h2> Looking ahead </h2> 

<p> Cumberlands should be better this year in the 4th year under Shan Housekeeper as the head coach. However, they play in a very tough conference in the NAIA. Some NAIA experts see the top 6 teams in the Mid-South Conference finishing in the top 35 and they have UC finishing 6th. I think UC will come in 4th maybe even 3rd but 6th isn't out of the picture either. The MSC is just a tough conference.
</p>

<h2> Where they stand </h2>
For the first time since 2021 the UC Patriots will start the season mentioned in the NAIA Football Rankings. The Patriots received 2 votes putting them 35th in the nation. The last time the Patriots were ranked was October 2nd, 2023 when they were ranked 23.
