### Another Night, Another Sweep: We Are 30-0!

We just keep rolling! We defended our home court with another dominant performance tonight, cruising to a 3-0 sweep (25-16, 25-13, 25-10) over IU Southeast to extend our historic perfect season to an incredible **30-0**. Our offense was an absolute machine, and we made a statement from the very first serve.

#### How It Unfolded: A Masterclass in Dominance

From the get-go, we were in control. The first set was a testament to our offensive firepower. Tied early at 3-3, we started to pull away. A huge block by Alana Shiery and Sara Zampedri made it 5-3, and we never looked back. Midway through the set, with the score at 14-9, we absolutely took over. Sparked by a kill from Brynnley Bryant, we went on a tear, ultimately closing the set 25-16 on a powerful kill from Kara Gipson.

We were even more dominant in the second set, hitting an unbelievable **.500 as a team**. After an early back-and-forth, we broke a 6-6 tie and never trailed again. Savanah Jolly's serving and back-to-back kills from Sara Zampedri put us in command. With the score at 19-13, we slammed the door shut, ripping off a **6-0 run** to end the set 25-13.

The third set was a complete dismantling. We were on a mission to finish the job, and we raced out to a massive 9-2 lead, forcing an early timeout. The run didn't stop there, as we pushed the lead all the way to 15-5. From there, it was a clinic in execution. Fittingly, Sara Zampedri sealed the match with a kill, putting the finishing touches on a 25-10 set victory and another sweep for the record books.

### A Historic Night for Our Stars

*   **A New Milestone for Sara Zampedri:** It was a truly special night for Sara. Not only did she record her tenth double-double of the season with **12 kills and 14 digs**, but she also officially moved into **fourth place in program history with 1,273 career kills**! We are so proud to celebrate this incredible achievement with her.
*   **Brynnley Bryant, The Offensive Firepower:** Brynnley was simply unstoppable tonight, leading all players with a match-high **14 kills** on an impressive .387 hitting percentage.
*   **Kara Gipson's Unmatched Efficiency:** Kara was nearly perfect. She was a force at the net, finishing with **8 kills on a staggering .800 hitting percentage** to go along with 4 blocks.
*   **Savanah Jolly, The Conductor:** Our offense ran like a well-oiled machine thanks to Savanah, who dished out **34 assists** with precision all night long.

### By the Numbers

*   **Offensive Juggernaut:** We hit **.406 as a team** with 46 kills against only 5 errors.
*   **Defensive Wall:** We held IU Southeast to a **.065 hitting percentage**.
*   **Digging Deep:** We controlled the back row, winning the dig battle **63-44**.
