The #10 Cumberlands Patriots volleyball team continued its historic tear through the season on Saturday, defending their home court with a resounding 3-0 sweep (25-15, 25-19, 25-16) over rival Campbellsville. The victory pushes the Patriots' unprecedented winning streak to 22 matches and marks their 17th consecutive sweep, keeping their perfect record intact at 22-0.

The Patriots' defense was the story of the night, putting up a massive wall at the net and holding the Tigers to a paltry .040 hitting percentage for the match.

### Set 1: A Wall at the Net

Cumberlands established its defensive dominance from the very start. The front line, led by **Alana Shiery**, was impenetrable, forcing Campbellsville into numerous errors. The Patriots jumped out to an early lead and never looked back. With the defense firing on all cylinders, the offense followed suit, as kills from **Brynnley Bryant** and **Kara Gipson** helped UC cruise to a 25-15 opening set victory.

### Set 2: Battling Through a Tough Test

The Tigers came out fighting in the second set, trading points with the Patriots in a tightly contested frame. The score was knotted at 10-10 before Cumberlands began to pull away. A clutch ace from **Sara Zampedri** and key kills from **Bryant** helped create separation. Campbellsville kept it close, but the Patriots' balanced attack proved too much as they closed out the set 25-19.

### Set 3: Closing Out the Rivalry in Style

With the sweep in sight, a 7-0 run midway through the frame, fueled by the serving of **Davey Slaughter** and multiple blocks from **Alana Shiery**, broke the set wide open. The Patriots sealed the rivalry victory with two final blocks from **Shiery**, emphatically ending the night with a 25-16 win.
