## STEP 1 CHECK
THEY DID IT. THEY COMPLETED A PERFECT REGULAR SEASON.

### 32-0! We Are Perfect. We Are Champions. We Made History.

They freaking did it. We capped off a season for the ages with a dominant 3-0 sweep (25-14, 25-22, 25-22) over Freed-Hardeman to complete the first-ever **perfect regular season in program history**. 32 games, 32 wins. This wasn't just another victory; this was the final step on a historic journey, and we couldn't be prouder of what they have accomplished together. 

Not only did they go 32 and 0 but they **SWEPT** EVERY MID-SOUTH CONFERENCE MATCH. They lost 4 sets all season and 2 of those were in match 1 vs Indiana Tech. They played 100 sets the entire season and won 96 of them. That is **INSANE**.


### First Set: We Unleashed the Storm

We came out with a clear message: we were here to finish the job. After trading the first couple of points, we decided to take over. With Davey Slaughter at the service line, we unleashed an absolute storm, ripping off a massive **9-1 run** that left them stunned. It was a total team effort—a kill from Alana Shiery, a pair from Brynnley Bryant, and a wall at the net that forced error after error. Just like that, we turned a 1-1 tie into a commanding 10-2 lead. We were firing on all cylinders, hitting .292 as a team and never letting them get close. We cruised to a dominant **25-14** set win, setting the tone for a historic afternoon.

### Second Set: We Showed Our Championship Heart

Freed-Hardeman came out fighting in the second set, and we found ourselves in an absolute dogfight. It was a back-and-forth battle, with both teams trading blows. The score was tied an incredible 14 times, all the way up to 21-21. This was the moment that defines a championship team. With the set on the line, who would step up?

We did. A kill from Kara Gipson put us ahead 22-21. Then, we put up a wall. A massive block from Alana Shiery and Elaina Fischer gave us a two-point cushion at 23-22. A kill from Fischer put us on the brink, and we sealed the deal on the next point, winning the set **25-22**. When the pressure was at its highest, we were at our best.

### Third Set: We Finished the Job

We could feel history within our grasp, and we weren't going to be denied. We started strong once again, with another huge serving run from Davey Slaughter to give us an early 6-1 lead. But just like the set before, Freed-Hardeman fought back, eventually tying the score at 18-18. Once again, we were tested, and once again, we rose to the occasion.

Kara Gipson came up with a huge kill to break the tie, and then Sara Zampedri followed with a clutch service ace to make it 21-18. That was the separation we needed. We closed it out from there, and fittingly, a powerful kill from Brynnley Bryant sealed the **25-22** set win, the match victory, and our perfect, undefeated season.

### Our Stars of the Perfect Season Finale
