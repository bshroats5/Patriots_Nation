### 9-0. Next Man Up. We Found A Way.

We went into Perry Center without Kyle Duke, our leading scorer and primary offensive weapon. No excuses. No complaints. Just execution. Final score: Cumberlands 94, Alice Lloyd 81. We're 9-0, and we proved that this program is bigger than any one player. But let's be clear about what happened on that court.

---

### First Half: An Unacceptable Performance

#### The Opening Minutes: No Energy, No Execution

We started the game like we were sleepwalking. Yes, Javecckio Thomas got us on the board first with a layup, but then we proceeded to let Alice Lloyd – a 2-6 team – dictate the tempo. They hit back-to-back threes to go up 7-4. We were playing reactive basketball instead of imposing our will.

#### The First Major Breakdown (11:19 mark)

With 11:19 left in the first half, we were clinging to a 17-16 lead. Then the wheels came off. Alice Lloyd went on a **9-2 run** sparked by three-pointers from Alexander and Eversole. We turned the ball over three times in a two-minute span. Robinson got caught ball-watching and fouled on a fast break, giving them a three-point play. Suddenly we're down 26-19 and calling timeout. That's a lack of focus. That's a lack of discipline.

#### The Response That Wasn't Enough

Give Anthony Harris credit. He came off the bench and single-handedly kept us in the game, scoring **7 straight points** to pull us within three. But here's the problem: we never took control. We traded baskets. We let them get comfortable. Anderson hit two more threes for them. We're at home, we're ranked 12th in the country, and we're in a dogfight with a sub-.500 team.

#### The Final Sequence: Salvaging a Tie

With the clock winding down, Tanner Walton showed the kind of effort we needed all half. He grabbed an offensive rebound, missed the put-back, grabbed ANOTHER offensive board, and finally scored at the buzzer to tie it 43-43. That's three chances on one possession. If we had shown that effort for 20 minutes instead of 20 seconds, we'd have been up by 15.

**First Half Numbers That Tell The Story:**
- Shot just 45.2% from the field
- An abysmal 4-for-16 from three (25%)
- Only 1-for-2 from the free throw line (we only got to the line TWICE)
- Gave up 43 points to a team averaging 68 per game

### Second Half: Championship-Level Adjustments

#### The Message Was Clear

Whatever was said in that locker room, it worked. We came out like a different team. The first four minutes set the tone.

#### The Turning Point (16:21 mark, Second Half)

With the score 49-50, we finally woke up. Andrew McConnell knocked down a three off a Malachi Robinson assist to put us up 52-50. From that moment, we never trailed again. But it wasn't just the made shot – it was HOW we got it. Ball movement. Player movement. Making the extra pass. That's our system.

#### The Decisive Run (11:10 to 7:00 mark)

This is where we separated. Trailing 60-62, we unleashed a **15-3 run** that broke the game open:
- **11:10** - Thomas hits a three (first of the game) off a beautiful feed from Walton
- **10:54** - Forced turnover, no easy baskets
- **9:51** - Walton attacks the glass AGAIN, gets the and-one
- **9:28** - McConnell hits a pull-up jumper in transition
- **8:55** - Walton with another offensive rebound and put-back
- **8:24** - Smithers drills a three off a Bell assist

That's a 75-65 lead, and they never got closer than 8 points again.

#### Closing Time

The final 5 minutes were professional. No let-up. No coasting. Robinson got a huge block with 1:55 left. We hit our free throws (finally). Walton sealed it with a layup with 18 seconds left. Game over.

### Individual Performance Review

**Tanner Walton - Player of the Game**
- **The Stat Line:** 14 points, 14 rebounds (7 offensive), 7 assists
- **The Impact:** This was more than numbers. He had 5 of his offensive rebounds in crucial moments. His assist to Thomas for the go-ahead three changed the game. His energy in the second half was contagious.
- **The Grade:** A+. This is what we expect when opportunity knocks.

**Javecckio Thomas - The Anchor**
- **By The Numbers:** 21 points on 9-14 shooting, 9 rebounds, 2 blocks
- **Key Sequence:** Scored 8 points in the first 4 minutes of the second half when we needed to establish our presence
- **The Concern:** 2 early fouls in the first half limited his minutes. Can't put yourself in that position.

**Andrew McConnell - The Steadying Force**
- **Production:** 19 points, 7 rebounds, but...
- **The Bad:** 4 turnovers and shot just 4-10 from three
- **The Good:** Made the RIGHT shots at the RIGHT time. His three to take the lead. His pull-up in transition. Clutch.

**Anthony Harris - Spark Off The Bench**
- **Impact in 20 Minutes:** 9 points on 4-5 shooting
- **The Sequence:** His 7-point burst in the first half kept us from getting blown out
- **What We Need:** This energy and efficiency every night

**Malachi Robinson - Defensive Anchor**
- **The Numbers:** 5 blocks, 5 rebounds in just 20 minutes
- **The Reality:** Only 2-6 shooting, 4-8 from the line
- **The Takeaway:** His defensive presence changed shots even when he didn't block them

### The Statistical Domination

**Rebounding:**
- Total Rebounds: UC 60, Alice Lloyd 30
- Offensive Rebounds: UC 24, Alice Lloyd 6
- Second Chance Points: UC 31, Alice Lloyd 13

This is what we hang our hat on. We got FOUR times as many offensive rebounds. That's not luck. That's effort.

**Paint Scoring:**
- UC 46, Alice Lloyd 28
- Without our best scorer, we still dominated inside

**Bench Production:**
- UC 28, Alice Lloyd 18
- Next man up mentality in action

### What Needs To Be Fixed Immediately

1. **Three-Point Shooting: 27.3%**
   - McConnell: 4-10 (at least he made some)
   - Smithers: 3-10 (key makes but too many misses)
   - Bell: 0-6 (unacceptable - can't go 0-fer)
   - McLendon: 1-3 (limited attempts)
   - Total: 9-33. We're not going to win consistently shooting like that.

2. **Free Throw Shooting: 57.9%**
   - We went to the line just 19 times and made only 11
   - Robinson: 4-8 from the stripe
   - Walton: 2-3 
   - Thomas: 2-2 (at least someone can make them)
   - This has been a recurring issue. Championship teams make 75%+ from the line.

3. **First Half Defense**
   - Gave up 43 points on 46.9% shooting
   - Allowed NINE three-pointers
   - Let Koji Anderson (averaging 8 PPG) score 16 in the first half alone
   - No communication on switches. Players getting lost in transition.

4. **Turnover Differential**
   - 14 turnovers to their 8
   - Led to 9 points for them
   - Careless with the basketball, especially in transition

### Film Room Focus Points

**The Good - What We Build On:**

1. **Offensive Rebounding Clinic**
   - 24 offensive boards is elite level
   - Walton had 7, Thomas had 4, Robinson had 3
   - This is effort. This is want-to. This is Patriots basketball.

2. **Second Half Adjustments**
   - Outscored them 51-38
   - Held them to 38.5% shooting
   - Only allowed 6 three-pointers (compared to 9 in the first)
   - This shows we CAN lock down when focused

3. **Paint Domination**
   - 46 points in the paint without our best slasher
   - Thomas was unstoppable inside (9-14 shooting)
   - We imposed our physical will eventually

4. **Depth Stepping Up**
   - 28 bench points
   - Harris gave us huge minutes
   - Walton's career night
   - This is what a TEAM looks like

**The Bad - What Gets Corrected:**

1. **Slow Starts**
   - Can't spot teams 20-minute head starts
   - Energy and focus from the opening tip
   - Set the tone, don't respond to it

2. **Perimeter Defense**
   - They shot 12-31 from three (38.7%)
   - Too many open looks
   - Not running shooters off the line

3. **Transition Defense**
   - Gave up too many easy buckets
   - Not getting back in transition
   - Ball watching instead of finding shooters

### The Kyle Duke Factor

Let's address it directly. We were without our leading scorer who's averaging over 20 points per game. Did it show? Yes. Our offensive flow wasn't as smooth. We didn't have that go-to scorer who can create his own shot when we needed a bucket.

But here's what matters: **We still won by 13.**

That's depth. That's culture. That's guys understanding their roles and executing. When Duke comes back, we'll be that much better. But this game proved we're not a one-man team.

### Individual Development Notes

**For Walton:** This is your new standard. Not the points, but the effort. 14 rebounds and 7 assists? That's impacting winning.

**For Thomas:** Stay out of foul trouble. You're too important to be sitting with 2 fouls in the first half.

**For Bell:** 0-6 from three is a slump. Keep shooting. The makes will come. But find other ways to contribute when shots aren't falling.

**For Robinson:** Your defense was elite. Now bring that same energy to the offensive glass every possession.

**For McLendon:** Be ready. Your number will be called more. 17 minutes isn't enough - be aggressive.

### The Message Moving Forward

We're 9-0. That's a fact. But this game exposed issues that better teams will exploit:
- Poor three-point shooting
- Awful free-throw percentage  
- Slow starts
- Defensive lapses

We have film session Thursday at 3:30. Everyone better come ready to own their mistakes and get better.

The standard is excellence for 40 minutes, not 20. We got away with a half of basketball tonight. That won't work in conference play. That won't work in March.

### Final Thought

Finding ways to win when you're not at your best is a championship quality. We did that tonight. But don't mistake surviving for thriving. We have work to do.

The schedule doesn't get easier. IU Southeast on Monday. On the road. They'll have film of this game. They'll see the weaknesses.

We better be ready.

**Next Practice Focus:**
1. Free throw shooting - 100 makes before anyone leaves
2. Three-point shooting drills - game speed, game tired
3. Defensive shell drill - 20 minutes on rotations
4. Film review - every player accountable for their mistakes

We're 9-0. We control our own destiny. But we're not satisfied with where we're at. We're focused on where we're going.

Championship teams get better every day. That's the standard. That's the expectation.

On to Monday vs IU Southeast. On to 10-0. But first, we get better.
