# Women’s Basketball Recap
## Fredricks Ties Program Rebounding Record as #18 Cumberlands Dominates Tennessee Wesleyan 85-48

### Game Summary
In a historic display of dominance in the paint, the #18 University of the Cumberlands Patriots extended their winning streak to seven games with a convincing **85-48** victory over Tennessee Wesleyan at the Southeastern Classic. The victory improves the Patriots' record to **13-1**, while Tennessee Wesleyan falls to 4-8.

The narrative of the afternoon was defined by senior **Zaram Fredricks**, who delivered a career-defining performance. Fredricks etched her name into the program record books by pulling down **25 rebounds**, tying the single-game school record previously set by Allison Wilburn (1981) and Allison Smith (1986). It marked the first time a Patriot has recorded 25 rebounds in a game in nearly 40 years.

### Analytical Breakdown
*   **Dominance on the Glass:** The statistical disparity in rebounding was the deciding factor of the contest. Cumberlands outrebounded Tennessee Wesleyan by a staggering margin of **65-24**. Most notably, the Patriots grabbed 28 offensive rebounds—more than TWU’s total rebound count for the entire game. This aggression led to **25 second-chance points** compared to just 7 for the Bulldogs.
*   **Interior Control:** The Patriots utilized their size advantage effectively, outscoring the Bulldogs **44-6 in the paint**. Fredricks (20 points) and Joy Kendrick (19 points) consistently attacked the rim, leading to high-percentage shots. Consequently, UC shot **47.4%** from the field, while their defense held TWU to just **27.4%** shooting and forced 15 turnovers.
*   **Defensive Stifling:** After a competitive opening few minutes where UC led only 9-5, the Patriots' defense locked in. A **15-0 run** in the second quarter blew the game open. They held TWU to just 16.7% shooting in the second period, taking a commanding 41-22 lead into halftime.

### Key Performances
*   **Zaram Fredricks (UC):** 20 Points, 25 Rebounds (9 Offensive), 3 Blocks. An absolute two-way force, Fredricks accounted for nearly 40% of the game’s total rebounds.
*   **Joy Kendrick (UC):** 19 Points, 6 Rebounds, 2 Steals. Kendrick was highly efficient, shooting 8-of-14 from the floor.
*   **Aden Clark (UC):** 13 Points, 4 Assists. Clark provided perimeter spacing, hitting 2-of-4 from three-point range.

### Looking Ahead
The Patriots will look to close out the calendar year on a high note when they host Union Commonwealth on Tuesday, December 30, at 5:00 p.m.

## RV Pikeville Hands Cumberlands First Loss of Season in 86-80

### Game Summary
In a heavyweight clash between two of the NAIA’s premier programs, the University of the Cumberlands suffered their first defeat of the 2025-26 campaign, falling **86-80** to the University of Pikeville. Despite a heroic 32-point effort from Kyle Duke, the Patriots (13-1) could not overcome a massive disparity at the free-throw line, allowing Pikeville (12-2, 7-0) to pull off a massive upset.

The game was a story of two halves. Cumberlands held a slim 40-38 advantage at halftime behind efficient shooting, but the Bears controlled the pace in the second half, outscoring the Patriots 48-40 in the final twenty minutes.

### Analytical Breakdown
*   **The Free Throw Disparity:** The game was ultimately decided at the charity stripe. Pikeville was elite from the line, converting **31-of-34 attempts (91.2%)**. In contrast, Cumberlands struggled to get to the line and capitalize, shooting just **13-of-20 (65%)**. This 18-point differential at the line negated UC’s superior field goal shooting.
*   **Efficiency vs. Volume:** Analytically, Cumberlands shot the ball better from the floor (49.2% FG) and from deep (50% 3PT) compared to Pikeville (45.5% FG, 29.4% 3PT). However, Pikeville mitigated this shooting gap by forcing turnovers (10 steals) and attacking the paint, where they outscored UC **40-30**.
*   **Clutch Execution:** In the closing minutes, Pikeville’s guards, specifically Jaylan Rigdon and LA Walker, refused to miss free throws. Despite late buckets by UC’s Brant Smithers and Duke, Pikeville’s ability to maximize possessions without the clock running prevented a Patriots comeback.

### Key Performances
*   **Kyle Duke (UC):** 32 Points, 6 Rebounds, 11-18 FG. Duke was the best player on the floor, scoring efficiently from all three levels with a usage rate of 35.9%.
*   **Brant Smithers (UC):** 16 Points. Smithers provided a spark from deep, though foul trouble (team-high fouls) limited defensive aggression late.

### Impact
This loss snaps Cumberlands' undefeated start to the season, moving them to **13-1**. While the Patriots showed they can score with high efficiency against top-tier competition, defensive discipline regarding fouls and free-throw conversion rates proved to be the difference against a disciplined Pikeville squad.
