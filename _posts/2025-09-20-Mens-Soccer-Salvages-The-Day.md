All praise goes to the Men's soccer team as they have their best performance of the season beating #13 Cumberland University 5-0 on the road and down a man for over half the match. The #2 UC Women's Patriots was upset by Cumberland 2-1 earlier in the day. Also earlier in the day the UC Football team was beaten by #2 Keiser 42-12.

# Cumberlands (KY) Stun Undefeated Cumberland (TN) With 5-0 Rout  

**Lebanon, Tenn. — September 20, 2025**

The clash between **Cumberlands Patriots** and the unbeaten **Cumberland Phoenix** was supposed to be a test of survival for the Patriots. Instead, it became a statement. In front of a stunned home crowd at Lindsey Donnell Stadium, the Patriots buried the Phoenix under wave after wave of pressure, walking away with a resounding **5-0 victory**.

## A Dream Start  
From the opening whistle, Cumberlands played like a team with something to prove. Their intent was clear in the 10th minute when **Mario Fernandez** slipped a smart ball through to **Hugo Champalloux**, who coolly slotted home the opening goal. The early strike silenced the stands and rattled the confidence of a Phoenix side that hadn’t yet tasted defeat this season.  

Champalloux wasn’t done there. Ten minutes later, he returned the favor, laying off a perfect assist for **Bruno Marques**, who blasted the ball into the net for a 2-0 cushion. By the 44th minute, the Patriots had completely seized control when **Leandro Nico Romero** finished a worked sequence set up by **Tjerk Meijs**, sending Cumberlands into halftime up **3-0** and in complete command.

## Tensions Boil Over  
But the night wasn’t just about goals — it was also about the growing heat of the rivalry on the pitch. Tackles grew harder, tempers shorter.  

- In the 17th minute, **Ryota Nakamura** picked up the first yellow for Cumberlands after a clumsy challenge.  
- Just two minutes later midfielder **Bruno Garcia** joined him in the book.  
- The Phoenix lost their composure too: defender **Alejandro Vega** saw yellow in the 26th, then again in the 43rd, resulting in a **first-half ejection**. With Cumberland reduced to ten men, the mountain they faced turned into an impossible climb.  

By the time halftime arrived, the Patriots not only had a commanding lead but also a man advantage.

## Crushing the Phoenix  
The second half opened the same way the first ended: with Cumberlands dictating play. Just three minutes after the restart, **Mario Fernandez** once again worked his magic, feeding Marques for his **second goal of the night** and pushing the scoreline to 4-0.  

Even with several players already carrying yellows — including **Abdulah Adams** and **Ryoma Ichihara** — the Patriots never lost their edge. Their discipline was tested, but their momentum was unstoppable.  

The finishing touch came in the 79th minute. Off a delicate setup from **Luca Piazza**, **Bruno Garcia** redeemed his earlier booking with a well-taken goal to round out the score at 5-0.

## Final Whistle: Triumph for the Patriots  
By the end, the stats told a lopsided story, but the mood told another: frustration and disappointment for the Phoenix, jubilation for Cumberlands.  

A team that came in 3-2-2 had just handed an undefeated 6-0-2 side its first and most humiliating loss — on their own field. The five goals, the fearless play, and even the willingness to withstand a flurry of yellow cards combined for a performance that won’t soon be forgotten.  

As the Patriots walked off the pitch, heads held high, one truth was undeniable: **Cumberlands (KY) had arrived, and they had done it in emphatic style.**  

**Final Score: Cumberlands (KY) 5, Cumberland (TN) 0**  

## What's Next

#4 Cumberlands will travel up I-75 and face rival Georgetown College (2-4-1) on Tuesday (9/23) at 8 PM at Toyota Stadium.
