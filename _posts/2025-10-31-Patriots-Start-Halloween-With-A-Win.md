### We Answered the Bell and Stayed Perfect!

We knew today was going to be a battle, and we rose to the occasion, securing a hard-fought 77-64 victory to keep our undefeated season rolling at 3-0. This wasn't just a win; it was a statement. We showed our firepower by building a massive lead, and when Milligan threw their best punch, we showed our heart by punching right back to seal the deal.

#### How It Unfolded: A Courtside View

**First Quarter: We Set the Tone Early**

Right from the opening possession, we sent a message. Milligan tried to score inside, and Zaram Fredricks immediately sent their shot packing with a huge block. That defensive stand ignited us. Darcie Anderson and Lakin Burke scored back-to-back buckets to get us started, and we were off and running on an 8-0 run that had us firmly in control at 8-1. After Milligan got on the board, we answered again. Aden Clark came off the bench and was an absolute flamethrower, hitting a three-pointer and then a jumper in the paint to stretch our lead to a commanding 15-3.

Milligan didn't back down and strung together an 8-0 run of their own to close the gap, but we had the final say. A strong drive and finish by Peyton Mounce before the buzzer ensured we ended the quarter with a solid 20-11 lead.

**Second Quarter: Keeping Our Foot on the Gas**

We carried that momentum right into the second. A beautiful connection from Lakin to Amy Thompson for a fast-break layup got us started, and a huge three from Peyton Mounce pushed our lead to 15. The game became a back-and-forth battle, but we always had an answer. When Milligan cut the lead to eight, Darcie hit a clutch three to push it right back to double digits. Late in the half, Joy Kendrick and Aden Clark took over, hitting consecutive pull-up jumpers in the final minute to send us into the locker room with a comfortable 44-32 advantage.

**Third Quarter: A Game of Two Halves**

We came out of halftime looking to put the game away for good. A putback from Jaydyn Carrico, a tough drive by Joy, and four straight points from Zaram inside blew the game wide open. We were suffocating on defense and unstoppable on offense. When Lakin Burke knocked down a pair of free throws with 3:50 on the clock, we had reached our biggest lead of the game at 60-36. It was total domination.

But then, the momentum shifted. Milligan threw everything they had at us, hitting a barrage of shots and closing the quarter on an incredible 17-2 run. Suddenly, our 24-point cushion had dwindled to just nine, and we went into the final quarter with the score at 62-53.

**Fourth Quarter: We Responded Like Champions**

This was the gut-check moment, and we answered the bell. We started the fourth quarter with lockdown defense and pure determination. We forced turnover after turnover, and it fueled an immediate 8-0 run to start the period. Joy Kendrick was simply unstoppable, scoring four straight points to push our lead right back to a commanding 70-53.

Milligan made one last desperate push with an 8-0 run of their own, but we didn't flinch. We got to the free-throw line and closed the game out with ice in our veins. Lakin, Joy, and Noel Smith all knocked down crucial free throws in the final two minutes to secure the 77-64 victory.
